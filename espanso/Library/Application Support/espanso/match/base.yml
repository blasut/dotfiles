# espanso match file

# For a complete introduction, visit the official docs at: https://espanso.org/docs/

# You can use this file to define the base matches (aka snippets)
# that will be available in every application when using espanso.

# Matches are substitution rules: when you type the "trigger" string
# it gets replaced by the "replace" string.
matches:
  # Simple text replacement
  - trigger: ":espanso"
    replace: "Hi there!"

  # Bug template Jira
  - trigger: ">>tjira"
    replace: |
      _[Provide a clear and concise description of the task including what needs to be done, why it's needed, and any context that is important for understanding the task.]_

      **User Value:**
      _[Explain how this task will add value to the end-user, improve their experience, satisfy their needs, or solve a problem they are facing.]_

      **Open questions:**
      - [Question 1]?

      ---

      **Acceptance Criteria/Definition of Done:**
      - [Criteria 1]
      - [Criteria 2]
      - [Criteria 3]

      _[Include detailed, bullet-pointed criteria that need to be fulfilled in order for the task to be considered 'done'.]_

  # NOTE: espanso uses YAML to define matches, so pay attention to the indentation!

  # But matches can also be dynamic:

  # Print the current date
  - trigger: ":date"
    replace: "{{mydate}}"
    vars:
      - name: mydate
        type: date
        params:
          format: "%m/%d/%Y"

  # Print the output of a shell command
  - trigger: ":shell"
    replace: "{{output}}"
    vars:
      - name: output
        type: shell
        params:
          cmd: "echo 'Hello from your shell'"
