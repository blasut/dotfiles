;; These package prints the accessible keymaps in a pretty format. 
;; See also: http://www.ph.utexas.edu/~jonganc/emacs.html

;; Short usage guide:
;; Run: (pkb-html-save-keymap KEYMAP OUTPUT-FILE-NAME).

;; Note about output: The html currently uses CSS 3, so it won't look good in older web browsers. Sorry.

;; Customizing:
;; The functions are designed so that the output can be extensively customized to adapt to the end-user's desires. Look at the help function for `pkb-html-save-keymap' for more info.

;; Design philosophy:
;; The package is actually split into two parts, pkb and pkb-output. The first part contains a set of functions that extract the key-bindings and assemble them into a useful format; the second part interfaces with pkb to turn the key-bindings into pretty output. Generally, the end-user will call a function in the second part. Currently, pkb-output = pkb-html, i.e. the output is in html. However, since much of the logic is contained separately in pkb, it shouldn't be to hard to edit the code to make, e.g. pk-latex, which would output in LaTeX format.

;; Here is a slightly more explicit codification of the design philosophy: 
;; 1) If a task is sufficiently general that it would be useful for generating outputting in more than one format it should be placed as a function(s) in pkb rather than pkb-output.
;; 2) If there is a subtask in a function in pkb and different applications or users might reasonably want that subtask to behave in very different ways, that subtask may need to be split off as a separate function so that each application or user can perform that subtask according to his needs.
;;   2a) It is OK if the new function (generated from the subtask) is rather abstract or not entirely self-contained logically as long as splitting it off provides useful customization options. As a result, a function in pkb-output may need to call several functions in pkb to accomplish some task and may also need to stitch together low-level or intermediate data. This is OK.
;;   2b) On the other hand, if all reasonable desired behaviors can be handled elegantly by passing an argument to the original function, the subpart does not need to be and should not be split off.

;; Why this philosophy? I'm somewhat indecisive and I'm not entirely sure how the output should look. So I designed the underlying code to be very adaptable.

;; To improve:
;; 1) Appearance of output could be made much prettier. I haven't spent too much time on this.
;; 2) The current default settings are aimed at me and my keyboard. However, by customizing the various default variables (e.g. `pkb-include-base-key-list', `pkb-html-event-replace-bk', `pkb-key-groups', etc.) it should be fairly straightforward to adapt the code for different keyboards and/or users. In fact, it would probably be possible to set these settings by detecting some system variables if someone were interested in implementing that.
;; 3) (technical issue) pkb-transl-... should be done before rather than during  `pkb-categorize-key-list' for conceptual simplicity

;; The following are some abbreviations used in the comments and
;;  help. An 's' suffix means plural, e.g. "bks" or "kss"
;; "bk" = "base-key" - An unmodified event, like that given `event-basic-type'.
;; "mk" = "modified-key" - An event, possibly including modifiers,
;;   e.g. 'C-A' or 'M-5'.
;; "ks" = "key-sequence" - A series of keys equivalent to a single action in
;;   emacs
;; "bind" = "key-binding" - The command bound to a key sequence.
;; "pk" = "prefix-key"
;; "root" - the kss in a keymap with no prefix-keys, e.g. 'A' or 'C-A' as
;;  opposed to 'C-c A'.
;; "mods-type" - a list of modifiers as returned by `event-modifiers',
;;   e.g. (control alt).
;; "options list" - a list that can specify how to print an object or other
;;   pieces of information related to the object (e.g. as in BIND-OPTIONS
;;   that accompanies a binding)

;; The format of some of the arguments passed between functions:
;; MKS - a list of ONE-MK's, each of which is of form
;;    (MK MK-OPTIONS BIND . BIND-OPTIONS),
;;  where MK-OPTIONS, BIND-OPTIONS can contains options about how to
;;  print MK or BIND
;; BKS-W-BINDS - a list of ONE-BK-W-BINDs, each of which is of the form
;;    (BK BK-OPTIONS MODS-TYPE-W-BIND-1 ... MODS-TYPE-W-BIND-n),
;;  where MODS-TYPE-W-BIND-i = (MODS-TYPE-i BIND-i . BIND-i-OPTIONS) and
;;  MODS-TYPE is a list of modifiers as would be returned by
;;  `event-modifiers'.
;; BINDS-CHAR-TABLE is a char-table holding bindings. Its element will
;;  be of the form (MK-OPTIONS BIND . BIND-OPTIONS).
;; BLOCKS-PRELIM - a list of ONE-BLOCK-PRELIMs, each of which is a list of
;;  ONE-BK-W-BINDS.
;; BLOCKS - a list of ONE-BLOCKs, each of which is a list of the form
;;   ( ('bks (BK-1 . BK-1-OPTIONS) ... (BK-n . BK-n-OPTIONS) )
;;     (MODS-TYPE-1 BIND-W-OPT-1-1 ... BIND-W-OPT-1-n)
;;     ...
;;     (MODS-TYPE-m BIND-W-OPT-m-1 ... BIND-W-OPT-m-n)) ,
;;  where a BIND-W-OPT is of the form (BIND . BIND-OPTIONS). Note that the
;;  first element of a ONE-BLOCK is a row of base-keys (and actually
;;  contains the symbol `bks') and is different from the following
;;  elements.
;; KEY-GROUPS is a list of the key-groups for a full keymap. A key-group or
;;  ONE-KEY-GROUP is a list of the form
;;   ( (group-name &optional NUM-FOR-FULL-GR OPTIONS) 
;;     BKS-IN-ONE-BLOCK-1 ... BKS-IN-ONE-BLOCK-k),
;;  where BKS-IN-ONE-BLOCK-i is a list of the form (BK-1 ... BK-n), i.e. a
;;  list of the bks expected for ONE-BLOCK-i. NUM-FOR-FULL-GR gives the
;;  number of base-keys that need to be defined for the group to be printed
;;  as a full-gr; NUM-FOR-FULL-GR can be omitted. OPTIONS is intended for
;;  additional group-specific options to be specified.
;; A GROUPS list is a list of ONE-GROUPS. A ONE-GROUP is a list in one of
;;  two forms:
;;   1) ('full-gr (GROUP-NAME OPTIONS) . BLOCKS-PRELIM).
;;   2) ('compact-gr (GROUP-NAME OPTIONS) . BKS-W-BINDS).

    ;;            ([?: ?r] [?: ?r ?t]) ) )    .
    ;;   In other words, each branch of INC-EXC-HIERARCHY is a list with the
    ;;   structure:
    ;;   ( (INC-PK EXC-PK-1 ...) SUBBRANCH-1 ...),

    ;;   keymap. If not, that keymap is OK to be include. E.g., considering a

\(i.e. printed with all base-keys, even those without bindings) if at least
PERCENT-FOR-FULL-GR percent of base-keys in the group have
bindings. PERCENT-FOR-FULL-GR defaults to 70%.

The format for KEY-LIST is the same as the cdr of the output from
`pkb-categorize-key-list' for a full keymap, i.e. a cons of the form
\(BKS-W-BINDS . BINDS-CHAR-TABLE). Note that the elements of KEY-LIST may be
modified by this command.

KEY-GROUPS is a list of the key-groups for a full keymap. A key-group is a
list of the form
  ( (group-name &optional NUM-FOR-FULL-GR OPTIONS) 
    BKS-IN-ONE-BLOCK-1 ... BKS-IN-ONE-BLOCK-k),
where BKS-IN-ONE-BLOCK-i is a list of the form (BK-1 ... BK-n), i.e. a list
of the bks expected for ONE-BLOCK-i. NUM-FOR-FULL-GR gives the number of
base-keys that need to be defined for the group to be printed as a full-gr;
NUM-FOR-FULL-GR can be omitted, whereby PERCENT-FOR-FULL-GR is used
instead. OPTIONS is intended for additional group-specific options to be
specified.

The output will be 
\(BKS-W-BINDS-USED REMAINING-BKS-W-BINDS . GROUPS).
BKS-W-BINDS-USED is a list of all the BKS-W-BINDS in the groups, each one
contained exactly once (so that they can converted for
output). REMAINING-BKS-W-BINDS will hold all bindings not listed in
GROUPS. Note that the BKS-W-BINDS in REMAINING-BKS-W-BINDS are not also in
BKS-W-BINDS-USED.
 
GROUPS is a list of ONE-GROUP's, each of which is in one of two formats:
 1) ('full-gr (GROUP-NAME OPTIONS) . BLOCKS-PRELIM).
 2) ('compact-gr (GROUP-NAME OPTIONS) . BKS-W-BINDS)."
